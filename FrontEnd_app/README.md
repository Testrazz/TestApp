# Cricket Tournament App - Monorepo

A comprehensive Tournament Scoring & Fan Engagement App built with modern web and mobile technologies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This is a **monorepo** using **Yarn workspaces** with 3 packages:

- **`/packages/shared`** - Shared logic, types, and services
- **`/packages/web`** - React 18 + Vite PWA for fans/organizers
- **`/packages/mobile`** - React Native (Expo) for scorers + fans

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

# Return to root
cd ../..
```

### Development

```bash
